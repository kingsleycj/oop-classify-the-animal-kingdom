# Classification-of-The-Animal-Kingdom

An Introductory test on Object-Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code. The data is in the form of fields, and the code is in the form of procedures. A common feature of objects is that procedures are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields.

**Four Principles of Object-Oriented Programming:**

### 1. Inheritance 
- This is a way of expanding an already existing class and extending its properties as well.

### 2. Abstraction 
- Its a method of representing an entity without showing the implmentation details.

### 3. Polymorphism 
- Its a way of implementing the same object or methd in multiple forms for different purposes.

### 4. Encapsulation 
- This is a way of hiding information from being accessible by some classes. Its a way of making private methods.


### How to Use

**Method 1:** 
- run the replit link and see the result : [Replit Link](https://replit.com/@kingsleycj/OOP-classification-of-animal-kingdom#index.js)
